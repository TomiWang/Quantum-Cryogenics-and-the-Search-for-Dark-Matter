Theorems:
1. Boltzmann Distribution for Particle Interactions
   - Describes the particle interactions of dark matter which follows a probability distribution governed by the Boltzmann equation f(v) ∝ exp (-(mv^2)/(2kbT))
   - In short, cryogenics slow the particles velocity (reducing kT) resulting in lower number of high velocity particles and increasing the number of low velocity particles. This allows for better detection, lower mass is
     also benificial.
   Where:
        f(v) = velocity distribution of particles
        m = mass of the particle
        v = velocity of the particle
        kb = Boltzmann constant
        T = temperature
        kbT = thermal energy per particle
        
2. Stefan-Boltzmann Law for Cryogenic Cooling
   - Describes how a cryogenic system loses heat through radiation by the equation P = εσAT^4
   Where:
        P = power radiated (amount of heat loss)
        ε = emissivity (how much a surface emits heat)
        σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant
        A = surface area
        T = temperature
   - The key idea for this theorem is that heat loss increases with temperature T^4
   - In order to keep the cryogenic system cold, we reduce emissivity using reflective coatings and MLI insulation, minimizing radiative heat loss. This process lets us achieve desired cryogenic temperatures!
   - MLI stands for Multilayer Insulation which consists of many thin reflective layers like mylar or kapton seperated by insulating spacers. Reduces radiative heat by reflecting infared radiation between layers,
     preventing heat from reaching the cryogenic system.
   - Reflective coatings are just highly reflective metallic coatings like aluminum or gold applied to surfaces. They reduce emissivity meaning heat is radiated away.


Mathematical Definitions:
1. Quantum Noise and Energy Sensitivity
   - Cryogenic detectors are used to find very tiny energy changes. Changes that occur when dark matter hits something.
   - This is given by E = h * f
   Where:
         E = One photon (Energy of one quantum)
         h = Planck's constant (6.626e-34 Js)
         f = The frequency of how fast the wave is vibrating
   - Cryogenic detectors allows us to reduce random heat movement (thermal noise) which is beneficial as it makes really small energy changes detectable. This gets us as close as possible to the smallest amount
     of energy nature allows us to measure, the quantum limit.

2. Thermal Noise Reduction
   - All electronic circuits contain some level of natural noise. This is called thermal noise and it is caused by the movement of particles due to heat. This is known as the Johnson-Nyquist noise.
   - This is given by Vn = sqrt(4 * k * T * R * deltaF)
   Where:
         Vn = Voltage noise
         k = Boltzmann's constant
         T = Temperature
         R = Resistance
         deltaf = Bandwidth (Range of frequencies the detectors analyze)
   - This is another scenerio when we use cryogenic detectors. As temperature lowers, noise reduction occurs. Sensitivity of tiny signals are more detectable when there is less noise.


Experimental Methods:
1. Cryogenic Detectors in the XENON Experiment
   - The XENON experiment is one of the world's leading dark matter detection projects. It uses liquid xenon as a torget for dark matter interactions. Cryogenics is crucial for this experiement as xenon must be
     maintained near 165 K to keep it at liquid state.
   - Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP), a hypothetical dark matter particle hits a xenon atom and will result in two outcomes.
      - Scintillation light which is a tiny flash of light
      - Ionization electrons is when electrons are released free
   - Sensitive detectors such as Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs) pick up faint light. The cryogenic temperatures assist with the visibility of these signals.
   - Energy deposition is analyzed using: Edep = Escint + Eion
   Where:
         Edep = Total deposited energy
         Escint = Energy associated with scintillation
         Eion = Energy from ionization

2. Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs)
   - Another highly used experimental projects for dark matter detection.
   - This method is a high-precision measurement of weak magnetic fields potentially induced by axionic dark matter, another hypothetical extremely light subatomic particle.
   - SQUIDs rely on a special quantum effect called Josephson effect. The magnetic field they detect is called magnetic flux Φ. An eelctric current with prcice quantum way given as Φ = (h/2e) * I
   Where:
         Φ = Magnetic flux
         h = Planck's constant (6.626e-34 Js)
         e = Electron charge
         I = Phase difference, current
   - This experiment would not work without cryogenics. Superconducting means no resistance and the goal for this experiment is for materials to be superconductive.
   - At cryogenic temperatures quantum noise is minimized leaving devices to have very small changes in magnetic fields.
   - XENON experiment may work but it wouldn't be nearly as effective or function properly.
